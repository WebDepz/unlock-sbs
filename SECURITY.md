# Security Policy

We take security and user trust seriously.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Email **security@unlock.sbs** (or open a private security issue). We aim to respond within **72 hours**.

## Scope

- Extension code under `/src` (including content scripts and options).
- Static site/docs under `/docs`.
- Published JSON bundles (if any) hosted on our domain.

## Out of scope

- Third-party services we merely link to (e.g., Wayback Machine).
- User-generated JSON files imported into the extension.

## Expectations

- Please provide clear reproduction steps and impact.
- Do not disclose publicly until we confirm a fix timeline.
